BIMM 143 Notes --

- Use nucleotide BLAST for nucleotide (i.e. DNA) sequences

- E value is the likelihood that the BLAST result / matching happens by chance

- Higher coverage and lower identity versus lower coverage and higher identity? Depends on the context

- One less intron than exon

- Gene ontology, gene info on aligment page on NCBI BLAST website

- REFSEQ
